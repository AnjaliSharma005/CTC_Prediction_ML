This project aims to predict employee salaries (CTC) using machine learning models based on various features such as previous CTC, job change history, graduation marks, experience, college tier, city type, and role. The goal is to assist organizations in making fair and data-driven compensation decisions.
Workflow Summary:
Data Preparation: Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., city type, college tier, role), and scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed feature distributions and relationships to uncover trends and correlations influencing salary outcomes.

Model Development: Built and tested a variety of regression models, including:

Simple & Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso

Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost

Model Optimization: Applied cross-validation and GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters and improve accuracy.
